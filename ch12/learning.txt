In this chapter, we will learn how to control the thread behavior. We will look at attributes of thread.

Thread Limits:
Different thread limits exists for differnt implementation of threads.

Thread Atrributes:
pthread interface allows us to control the behavior of threads and
synchronization objects by setting various attributes associated with each object.

Synchronization Attributes:
Similar to threads attributes, synchronization objects have attributes.
In spin locks we have one attribute called the process-shared attribute.
Attributes of mutexes, readerâ€“writer locks, condition variables,
and barriers are studied.

Mutex Attributes:
Mutex attributes are represented by a pthread_mutexattr_t structure.
The mutex attributes object is initialized to default values by pthread_mutexattr_init. The thread attributes object is destroyed by pthread_mutexattr_destroy. It supports three attributes process-shared,robust and type attribute.

Reader-Writer lock attributes:
It has locks similar to mutexes.
pthread_rwlockattr_init  is used to initialize a pthread_rwlockattr_t structure and
pthread_rwlockattr_destroy to deinitialize the structure. Only process-shared attribute is supported by read write attributes.

Condition Variable Attribute:
It supports only two attributes ,the process-shared attribute and the clock attribute.

Barrier Attribute:
We can use the pthread_barrierattr_init function
to initialize a barrier attributes object and the pthread_barrierattr_destroy
function to deinitialize a barrier attributes object. Only process shared attribute is defoned for Barriers.
