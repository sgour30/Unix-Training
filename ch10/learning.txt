Introduction:
Signals are software interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occurred. This chapter will deal with various signals and their action.

Signal concept :-
Every signal has a name. They all begin with the three characters SIG.
SIGABRT is the abort signal that is generated when a process calls the abort function.
SIGALRM is the alarm signal that is generated when the timer set by the alarm function goes off.

Different unix flavours supports different number of signals. All signal names are defined by positive integer only.
0 is not used by any signal as it is used by kill function for special case. It is also called null signal in POSIX.1
Signals can be generated by various reasons such as
1.Pressing special character on keyboard
2.Hardware Exception
3.Software Conditions

Signal Dispostion:- 
The kernel can perform three things when signal occurs. They are
i)Ignore the signal
ii)Catch the signal
iii)Let the default action apply.

Signal Function:-
It basically provides functionality to use various signal features and return previous disposition of signal.
It has two arguments
The first argument, signo, is an integer.
The second argument, func, is a pointer to a function that takes a single integer argument and returns nothing.

 Unreliable Signals : Signals in early UNIX versions were not always accurate.
 
 Interrupted System Calls
 System Calls are those where we ask to perform a function where as an interrupted System calls are those where the return value is some  error.
 There are divisions of interrupted System Calls
 Slow System calls -These system calls can hold a task forever.
 Automatic restarting of system calls .
