Signal concept :-Every signal has a name. They all begin with the three characters SIG.
SIGABRT is the abort signal that is generated when a process calls the abort function.
SIGALRM is the alarm signal that is generated when the timer set by the alarm function goes off.
Different unix flavours supports different number of signals. All signal names are defined by positive integer only.
0 is not used by any signal as it is used by kill function for special case. It is also called null signal in POSIX.1
Signals can be generated by various reasons such as
1.Pressing special character on keyboard
2.Hardware Exception
3.Software Conditions

Signal Dispostion:- The kernel can perform three things when signal occurs. They are
i)Ignore the signal
ii)Catch the signal
iii)Let the default action apply.
