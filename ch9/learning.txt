Terminal logins :-
It can be used to log in to a system using terminal of any type.
Be it character based , character based graphical or GU windowing system.

getty is a process that sets up the terminal.

Event flow of login:
pid 1(init)--fork-->init--exec-->getty--exec--> login

When the system is booted , kernel creates pid 1, i.e init process and 
init brings system to multiuser mode.The init process reads the file /etc/ttys and, for every terminal device that allows a login, does a fork followed by an exec of the program getty. 
getty calls open for the terminal device. The terminal is opened for reading and writing. Once the device is open, file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 are set to the device.
getty outputs something like login: and waits for us to enter our user name.
Invokes the login program: execle("/bin/login", "login", "-p", username, (char *)0, envp);

Now the login program will 1)change our home dir 
2)change ownership
3)change access permission
4)initialize environment

A process can join an existing process group or creates a new process group by calling setpgid.
